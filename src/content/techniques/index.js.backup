# Understanding SWOLF: Your Efficiency Score

SWOLF stands for **Swimming Golf** - like golf, lower scores are better!

## What is SWOLF?

SWOLF = Strokes per length + Time per length (in seconds)

**Example:**
- You swim 25m in 30 seconds
- You take 20 strokes
- Your SWOLF = 20 + 30 = **50**

## Why Does SWOLF Matter?

SWOLF measures your **swimming efficiency** - how well you balance speed with technique.

- **Low SWOLF (40-55):** Very efficient - smooth, powerful strokes
- **Medium SWOLF (55-70):** Good for recreational swimmers
- **High SWOLF (70+):** Room for improvement in technique or fitness

## Two Ways to Improve SWOLF

### 1. Reduce Stroke Count (Better Technique)
Take fewer, more powerful strokes per length.

**Focus on:**
- Longer glide phase
- Stronger pull-through
- Better body rotation

### 2. Swim Faster (Better Fitness)
Reduce your time per length while maintaining stroke count.

**Focus on:**
- Kick strength
- Aerobic fitness
- Pace consistency

## The Sweet Spot

The best swimmers optimize BOTH - efficient technique at fast speeds!

Don't just thrash harder - work smarter. 🏊‍♂️

# How to Reduce Your Stroke Count

Taking fewer strokes per length means you're gliding farther with each stroke - that's efficiency!

## Count Your Strokes

First, establish your baseline:

1. Swim one length counting each stroke
2. Count both arms (1 stroke = 1 arm pull)
3. Record your count

**Typical counts for 25m pool:**
- Beginners: 25-35 strokes
- Intermediate: 18-24 strokes
- Advanced: 14-18 strokes
- Elite: 10-14 strokes

## 5 Ways to Reduce Stroke Count

### 1. Extend Your Glide

After each stroke, glide forward before starting the next one.

**Drill:** Catch-up freestyle
- Keep one arm extended while the other completes a full stroke
- Only start next stroke when recovering arm "catches up"
- Forces you to glide longer

### 2. Improve Your Pull

Pull more water with each stroke = more distance per stroke.

**Key technique:**
- High elbow catch (keep elbow higher than hand)
- Pull straight back, not down
- Finish stroke at your hip, not halfway

### 3. Rotate Your Body

Body rotation adds power without extra strokes.

**Focus:**
- Rotate 30-45 degrees on each stroke
- Shoulders and hips move together
- Reach further forward on the extended arm

### 4. Streamline Off the Wall

Your push-off should be powerful and streamlined.

**Technique:**
- Tight streamline position (arms overhead, hands stacked)
- Dolphin kicks underwater
- Surface smoothly, resume stroke rhythm

### 5. Kick Efficiently

A strong kick maintains body position and momentum.

**Don't over-kick:**
- 2-beat or 6-beat kick pattern
- Kick from hips, not knees
- Small, fast kicks, not big splashy ones

## Practice Workout

Try this stroke count reduction workout:

- **4 x 50m**
  - 1st 50m: Count strokes (baseline)
  - 2nd 50m: Try for -2 strokes
  - 3rd 50m: Try for -3 strokes
  - 4th 50m: Try for -4 strokes (might be slower - that's okay!)
- **Rest 30 seconds between each**

## Progress Tracking

Set a goal: "I want to drop from 24 to 20 strokes per length in 4 weeks"

Track your stroke count each swim - you'll see patterns!

# Freestyle Technique Fundamentals

Freestyle is all about efficiency - smooth, powerful, relaxed.

## The 4 Phases of Freestyle

### 1. The Catch (Hand Entry to Elbow Bend)

**What to do:**
- Enter hand in front of shoulder, fingertips first
- Extend forward, rotate palm down
- Bend elbow to "catch" the water (high elbow!)

**Common mistakes:**
- ❌ Crossing centerline (hand enters in front of face)
- ❌ Flat hand (no elbow bend)
- ❌ Dropped elbow

### 2. The Pull (Power Phase)

**What to do:**
- Pull water straight back (not down!)
- Keep elbow higher than hand
- Accelerate through the pull
- Finish at your hip

**Think:** You're pulling yourself over the water, not pushing water down

### 3. The Recovery (Rest Phase)

**What to do:**
- Elbow exits water first (high elbow recovery)
- Relax your arm
- Swing arm forward close to body
- Hand stays relaxed (don't tense up!)

**This should feel easy** - it's called recovery for a reason!

### 4. The Glide (Extension Phase)

**What to do:**
- Extend arm fully forward
- Rotate body 30-45 degrees
- Glide for a moment before starting next catch
- This is where efficiency happens!

## Body Position

### Horizontal Alignment
- Head in neutral position (look down and slightly forward)
- Hips near surface (engage core!)
- Kick keeps legs up

### Body Rotation
- Rotate from your core, not just shoulders
- 30-45 degree rotation each side
- Breathe during rotation (don't lift head)

## Breathing Technique

**The Golden Rule:** Exhale underwater, inhale above water

**How to breathe:**
1. Exhale continuously through nose/mouth while face is down
2. Turn head to side (don't lift!) as arm recovers
3. Take quick breath
4. Face returns to water before arm enters

**Breathing pattern:**
- Beginners: Every 2-3 strokes
- Intermediate: Every 3-5 strokes (bilateral breathing)
- Advanced: Variable based on effort

## The Kick

**Purpose:** Maintain body position and add propulsion

**Technique:**
- Kick from hips, not knees
- Pointed toes (like a ballet dancer)
- Small, fast kicks
- Slight knee bend, but mostly straight leg

**Kick patterns:**
- 2-beat kick: One kick per arm stroke (distance swimming)
- 6-beat kick: Three kicks per arm stroke (sprint swimming)

## Putting It All Together

**Focus on rhythm:**
- Stroke-stroke-breathe (if breathing every 3)
- Glide-pull-recover (one arm at a time)
- Kick-kick-kick-kick-kick-kick (continuous)

**Practice progression:**
1. Master body position (streamline drills)
2. Add arms (focus on catch and pull)
3. Add breathing (every 3-5 strokes)
4. Add kick (integrate with arm rhythm)

## Common Freestyle Mistakes

1. **Lifting head to breathe** → Turn to side instead
2. **Crossing centerline** → Enter hand in front of shoulder
3. **Bent arm recovery** → High elbow, relaxed arm
4. **Scissor kick** → Keep legs close together
5. **Holding breath** → Exhale continuously underwater

## Your Action Plan

**This week:** Pick ONE element to focus on each swim
- Monday: High elbow catch
- Wednesday: Body rotation
- Friday: Breathing rhythm

Don't try to fix everything at once - progressive improvement!

# Mastering Consistent Pace

Consistent pacing is the mark of an experienced swimmer - it's not about going fast, it's about going *even*.

## Why Pace Matters

**The Problem:** Most swimmers start too fast and fade

**Example:**
- Lap 1-2: 1:50/100m (feels easy!)
- Lap 3-4: 2:00/100m (getting tired...)
- Lap 5-6: 2:15/100m (struggling!)
- **Average: 2:01/100m** with 25 seconds of variation

**The Solution:** Start controlled, finish strong

**Better:**
- Lap 1-2: 2:00/100m (controlled start)
- Lap 3-4: 1:58/100m (comfortable)
- Lap 5-6: 1:55/100m (faster finish!)
- **Average: 1:58/100m** with only 5 seconds variation

You swim **3 seconds faster** just by pacing better!

## How to Pace Yourself

### 1. Know Your Target Pace

Use your recent swims to find your sustainable pace.

**Method:**
- Check your average pace for 500-1000m swims
- Add 5-10 seconds = your "easy" pace
- Subtract 5-10 seconds = your "tempo" pace

**Example:**
- Average pace: 2:30/100m
- Easy pace: 2:35-2:40/100m
- Tempo pace: 2:20-2:25/100m

### 2. Use Stroke Count as a Pacer

Stroke count is more reliable than feel!

**Method:**
- Count strokes for first 2 lengths
- Keep that stroke count for entire swim
- If stroke count creeps up = you're slowing down

### 3. Negative Splitting

Start controlled, finish faster.

**Workout:**
- **8 x 100m**
- 1st 50m: Easy (2:40/100m pace)
- 2nd 50m: Tempo (2:20/100m pace)
- **Rest 20 seconds between**

You should feel like you're getting FASTER as you go!

### 4. Tempo Trainer

Use a tempo trainer (or metronome app) to maintain rhythm.

**How to use:**
- Set beep to match your stroke rate
- Example: Beep every 1.2 seconds = 50 strokes per minute
- Match your stroke timing to beeps

## Pacing Workouts

### Workout 1: Descending Set
Build speed while maintaining control

- **5 x 200m**
  1. 2:40/100m pace
  2. 2:35/100m pace
  3. 2:30/100m pace
  4. 2:25/100m pace
  5. 2:20/100m pace (fastest!)
- **Rest 30 seconds between**

### Workout 2: Even Pace Challenge
Hold target pace for entire set

- **10 x 100m @ 2:30/100m pace**
- **Rest 15 seconds**
- Goal: Every 100m within 3 seconds of target

### Workout 3: Negative Split Practice
Second half faster than first half

- **4 x 400m**
- 1st 200m: Easy pace
- 2nd 200m: 5 seconds per 100m faster
- **Rest 60 seconds**

## Reading Your Body

**Signs you're going too fast:**
- Breathing gets ragged by lap 3-4
- Stroke count increases each lap
- Can't maintain form in last quarter

**Signs you're well-paced:**
- Breathing stays controlled throughout
- Stroke count consistent (±1-2 strokes)
- Could swim another 25% distance

## Using Swimma to Track Pace

**Dashboard shows:**
- Average pace per swim
- Pace trend over time
- "Fast" or "Easy" badges based on your average

**Insights page shows:**
- Pace consistency over sessions
- Identify which swims had good pacing

**Ask AI:**
- "How consistent is my pacing?"
- "What's my optimal sustainable pace?"

## Practice Challenge

**This week:** Focus on even splits

Pick one swim this week:
1. Swim 500-1000m continuous
2. Count stroke rate every 100m
3. Goal: Stay within ±2 strokes

Track in Swimma and see if your pace is more consistent!

# Bilateral Breathing & Breathing Patterns

How you breathe affects your balance, technique, and endurance.

## What is Bilateral Breathing?

**Bilateral = Both sides**

Breathing on both your left and right side, rather than always breathing on the same side.

**Standard pattern:** Every 3 strokes
- Right arm, left arm, right arm, **breathe left**
- Left arm, right arm, left arm, **breathe right**

## Why Breathe Bilaterally?

### 1. Better Balance
Breathing only on one side creates asymmetric rotation - your body naturally favors that side.

**Result:**
- Swim in slight curve
- Uneven stroke development
- One shoulder stronger than other

### 2. Better Navigation (Open Water)
See both sides of the pool/lake - crucial for races!

### 3. More Balanced Stroke
Forces even technique on both sides.

## Breathing Patterns Explained

### Every 2 Strokes (Unilateral)
**When to use:** Sprint swimming, high-effort sets
- Right arm, left arm, **breathe right**
- Continuous pattern

**Pros:** Maximum oxygen
**Cons:** Asymmetric technique

### Every 3 Strokes (Bilateral)
**When to use:** Most training, distance swimming
- Right, left, right, **breathe left**
- Left, right, left, **breathe right**

**Pros:** Balanced technique, good oxygen
**Cons:** Takes practice to master

### Every 4-5 Strokes
**When to use:** Short sprints, underwater kick focus
**Pros:** More streamlined, less disruption
**Cons:** Lower oxygen (only for short bursts)

### Variable Breathing
**Advanced technique:** Mix patterns within one swim
- Easy pace: Every 3-5 strokes
- Tempo pace: Every 3 strokes
- Sprint pace: Every 2 strokes

## How to Learn Bilateral Breathing

### Week 1: Get Comfortable Breathing on Weak Side

**Drill:** One-sided focus
- 4 x 50m breathing only on weak side (every 2 strokes)
- Focus on smooth head turn, not lifting
- Rest 20 seconds

### Week 2: Introduce Every-3 Pattern

**Workout:**
- 25m: Breathe every 3 (bilateral)
- 25m: Breathe every 2 (comfortable side) - rest
- **Repeat 8 times**

### Week 3: Increase Bilateral Distance

**Workout:**
- 4 x 100m breathing every 3 throughout
- Rest 30 seconds
- Focus on rhythm, not speed

### Week 4: Make It Your Default

Try to breathe every 3 for most training swims.

## Troubleshooting

**"I run out of air breathing every 3!"**
- You're holding your breath - exhale continuously underwater
- Slow down your pace slightly
- Practice every-3 breathing during warm-up (low intensity)

**"I can't breathe smoothly on my weak side"**
- Practice side-kicking drill (see drills below)
- Focus on rotating body, not lifting head
- Be patient - it takes 2-4 weeks to feel natural

**"I lose my rhythm when breathing"**
- Count out loud in your head: "1-2-3-breathe, 1-2-3-breathe"
- Use pull buoy to isolate upper body
- Slow down tempo

## Drills for Better Breathing

### Side Kick Drill
- Kick on your side, bottom arm extended
- Bottom ear in water, look at pool bottom
- Top arm at your side
- Practice breathing position without swimming

### 3-5-3-5 Pattern
- 50m breathing every 3 strokes
- 50m breathing every 5 strokes
- Repeat
- Teaches breath control

### Hypoxic Swimming (Advanced)
- Breathing every 5, 7, or 9 strokes
- Short distances only (25-50m)
- Builds breath control and lung capacity
- Not for beginners!

## Your Action Plan

**This week:**
1. Test your comfortable breathing pattern (probably every 2 on one side)
2. Try 1-2 lengths breathing every 3
3. Note: Does it feel balanced?

**This month:**
Make bilateral breathing your default for easy/moderate swimming.

You'll feel off-balance at first - that's normal! Stick with it for 3-4 weeks and it becomes automatic.

    keyTakeaways: [
      'Bilateral breathing = breathing on both sides',
      'Most common pattern: every 3 strokes',
      'Improves balance and stroke symmetry',

# Perfect Your Streamline

The streamline position is the fastest position in swimming - faster than your stroke!

## What is Streamline?

**Definition:** The hydrodynamic position used off starts and turns.

**Position:**
- Arms extended overhead, locked out
- Hands stacked (one on top of other)
- Biceps squeeze ears
- Head neutral (look down)
- Body straight (no bend at hips)
- Legs together, toes pointed

**Why it matters:** You can glide 3-5 meters in perfect streamline - that's 2-4 free strokes!

## The Perfect Streamline

### Upper Body
1. **Arms:** Extend both arms overhead fully
2. **Hands:** Stack one hand on top of the other (thumbs hooked together)
3. **Head:** Squeeze head between biceps (ears covered)
4. **Shoulders:** Shrug shoulders up to ears
5. **Core:** Engage abs, straight line from hands to toes

### Lower Body
1. **Hips:** Don't pike! Keep hips in line with torso
2. **Legs:** Press together tightly
3. **Feet:** Point toes like ballet (ankle extension)
4. **Kick:** 3-5 dolphin kicks underwater (optional)

## Why Streamline Matters

### The Physics

**Drag increases with frontal surface area**

- Poor streamline: ~0.5 square meters of frontal area
- Perfect streamline: ~0.2 square meters of frontal area
- **Result: 60% less drag!**

### The Numbers

**In a 1000m swim (40 lengths):**
- 40 push-offs = 40 chances to streamline
- Good streamline: Glide 4 meters = **160 meters free**
- Poor streamline: Glide 2 meters = **80 meters gliding**
- **You just saved 80 meters of swimming!**

That's 6-8 seconds on your time, just from better streamlining!

## Common Streamline Mistakes

### 1. Wide Arms (Not Locked)
❌ Arms in "Y" shape overhead
✅ Arms in "I" shape, biceps squeezing head

### 2. Head Up (Looking Forward)
❌ Lifted head creates drag
✅ Neutral head (look at bottom of pool)

### 3. Bent at Hips
❌ Piked position (hips drop)
✅ Straight body line (engage core)

### 4. Feet Apart/Flexed
❌ Wide legs, flexed ankles
✅ Legs together, pointed toes

### 5. Breaking Streamline Too Soon
❌ Starting stroke immediately off wall
✅ Glide 3-5 meters before first stroke

## Streamline Drills

### Drill 1: Streamline Kick
- Push off wall in streamline
- Dolphin or flutter kick underwater
- Hold streamline until you surface
- Goal: Get to 10-12 meters mark underwater

### Drill 2: Streamline Glide
- Push off wall in perfect streamline
- NO kicking - just glide
- See how far you can coast
- Goal: Reach 5 meters before needing to stroke

### Drill 3: Streamline Comparison
- Length 1: Push off with poor streamline (test)
- Length 2: Push off with perfect streamline
- Count strokes per length
- You should need 2-3 fewer strokes with good streamline!

### Drill 4: 10-Second Hold
On deck before swimming:
- Stand and hold streamline position for 10 seconds
- Check: Ears covered? Core tight? Toes pointed?
- Muscle memory practice

## Improving Your Streamline

### Flexibility Work

**Shoulder flexibility:**
- Wall angels: Stand facing wall, arms overhead, slide up/down
- Doorway stretch: Hold doorframe, lean forward
- Do daily for 2 weeks = noticeable improvement

**Ankle flexibility:**
- Sit on heels (pointed toes) for 30 seconds
- Stretch tops of feet daily
- Use fins to practice pointed-toe position

### Strength Work

**Core strength:**
- Planks (hold streamline position on land)
- Flutter kicks on back (arms in streamline)
- Strengthens muscles needed to hold position

## Using Streamline in Your Swims

### Off Every Wall
1. Plant feet on wall
2. Strong push-off
3. Perfect streamline position
4. 3-5 dolphin kicks (if allowed)
5. Glide until slowing to stroke speed
6. Resume stroke

**Goal:** Never waste a turn!

### Starts (Races/Competitions)
1. Dive entry
2. Streamline immediately underwater
3. Dolphin kicks to 15m mark (or before)
4. Break streamline, begin stroke

## Challenge Yourself

**Streamline Test:**
- Push off in perfect streamline (no kick)
- Measure distance before needing to stroke
- **Good:** 4-5 meters
- **Great:** 5-7 meters
- **Elite:** 7-10 meters

Track your streamline distance monthly - it's a great measure of technique efficiency!

## Quick Wins

**This week:** Focus on streamline during EVERY push-off
- Check position each time
- Hold for 3-5 seconds
- Notice: Are you gliding farther?

**This month:** Practice streamline holds on deck for 10 seconds before each swim

You'll add streamlining to your muscle memory and see stroke count drop!
